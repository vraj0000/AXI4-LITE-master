# AXI4-Lite Master Interface

This repository contains a generic implementation of an AXI4-Lite Master interface designed to interact with processing units such as CPUs, GPUs, NPUs, and DPUs. The modules are designed to adhere strictly to the AXI4-Lite specification, enabling true parallelism and pipelined operation.

## Motivation

While learning AXI4-Lite, I came across many online examples. However, most of them were hardcoded implementations with fixed send/receive operations and serial channel access. These implementations lacked flexibility and did not fully utilize the parallel capabilities of the AXI4 specification. 

To address these limitations, I decided to create a generic and modular AXI4-Lite Master interface that supports true parallelism, pipelining, multi-burst transactions, and backpressure handling. This design is scalable and can be extended to support the full AXI4 specification in the future.

## Observations on AXI Limitations

One key limitation of AXI arises when interacting with non-pipelined slaves. If a slave device is not capable of pipelining its operations, the efficiency of the AXI protocol can be significantly reduced. For example:

- **Non-Pipelined Slave**: If a slave takes 10 cycles to process each write request and can only start processing the next request after completing the current one, sending 10 write addresses would require 110 cycles (10 cycles per request + 10 cycles of processing for each).
- **Pipelined Slave**: If the slave is pipelined and can process requests concurrently, the same 10 write addresses could be completed in just 20 cycles (10 cycles to send all addresses + 10 cycles for processing).

This highlights the importance of designing slaves with pipelining capabilities to fully utilize the parallelism offered by AXI. Without pipelining, the protocol's efficiency is wasted, and the system's overall performance suffers.

## Features

- **Generic Design**: The modules are parameterized, allowing customization of address and data widths.
- **True Parallelism**: Each AXI4 channel (write address, write data, write response, read address, read data) is implemented with a dedicated 2-state FSM for handshaking, enabling parallel operation.
- **Modular Structure**: The interface is divided into submodules for each channel, making it easier to understand, debug, and extend.
- **AXI4-Lite Compliance**: The implementation strictly follows the AXI4-Lite specification, ensuring compatibility with other AXI-compliant devices.
- **Scalability**: The design can be extended to support full AXI features, including burst transactions and advanced pipelining.

## Architecture

### Channel Modules
Each AXI4 channel is implemented as a separate module with a simple 2-state FSM for handshaking:
1. **Idle State**: Waits for a start signal from the master.
2. **Active State**: Performs the handshake with the subordinate (slave) and captures or sends data.

### Master Interface
The master interface module coordinates the operation of the individual channel modules. It contains two FSMs:
1. **Write FSM**: Handles the sequence of write operations (address -> data -> response).
2. **Read FSM**: Handles the sequence of read operations (address -> data).

The master interface ensures that the channels operate independently, enabling pipelined and parallel transactions.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed based on my study of the AXI4-Lite protocol and digital design principles. AI tools were used to assist with code generation and documentation, but the design, architecture, and implementation were entirely my own. The simulation results demonstrate the functionality of the AXI4-Lite Master interface, including proper handshaking and pipelined operation. Special thanks to online resources and examples that provided the foundation for understanding AXI4-Lite.
